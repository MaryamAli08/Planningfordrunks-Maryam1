							<h2>Introducing the Planning for Drunks project
							<br />
							
						</h2>
							
							<p> This project was developed as part of an assignment for geography programming course. There were several projects to choose from however, I choose to conduct the planning for drunk project.
								The project consists of exploring a town full of drunks and creating a program which guides drunks home. Futhermore, this website will explore each step in producing the drunks model. For more information , please press learn more. This will also guide you to the github page which holds the model informations.</p>

								<h3>About the development of the Project</h3>
								<p> The Planning for drunks project was introduced to produce an algorithm which examine a town full of drunks and help the drunks walk home from the pub.
								This project will be produced in Python, Sypder. Python is high level programming lanaguage which is successful at creating algorithms ,
								 softwares and  creating data visualisations.  
								 
								</p> Futhermore, the program will be implemented using a data file which contains the pub (the drunks are leaving ) and their homes (10, 250).The program will need to assign the drunks to a home before leaving the pub, allow the drunks to wonder around the town until they reach their assigned home. Additionally, the program also aims to exemplify the density of drunks passing through each point on a map.

								<h3>How to build the Drunks Program</h3>
								<p> 1. Introduce the data file to the model by employing the function import 'csv'. 
							    <p> 2. Exemplify the pub points and home points by using built-in functions such as 'enumerate'
							    <p> 3. Illustrate the drunks leaving the pub and their route home. 
								<p> 4. Examine the density of the drunks passing through each point of the map.
								<p> 5. The final step of project is to save the density map as a text file.

								<h3>Data Visualisations</h3>
								<p>To create a visualisation of the drunks route home, the import matplotlib.pyplot function was employed. The matplotlib.pyplot is an object oriented plotting library which enables to figures and plots to be created. 
								<p> This projects will exemplify using the matplotlib.pyplot , the drunks walk home and also will highlight when the drunks arrive at their assigned house. Also, the matplotlib.pyplot will be adopted to illustrate the density. </p> </p>

								<h3>Software Issues</h3>
								<p>There were several issues which occurred whilst building the drunks model. One issue was all the drunks were unable to return home, and continued to wonder in the middle of the town. This was a concern as the aim of the project to build an algorithm which walks drunks to their assigned homes. 
								<p>	This was successfully resolved by increasing the numofiterations by a few hundred. This helped to increase the chances of the drunks locating their house. Though, the increase in the num of iterations did result in a slower execution time, therefore the drunks do take longer to arrive home. Overall, the drunks did successfully arrive homesweethome.

								<h3>Drunks Framework</h3>
								<p>The Drunks Framework is a module which consists of the drunk class. In addition, a class is an outline and blue print for creating new objects. Therefore, the drunk class is a outline for the drunk model and will be examined alongside the main drunk model.py. </p>

								<h3>Density</h3>
								<p>The program will also illustrate the density of the drunks passing through each point on a map. This will be conducted by using the drunk class and introducing a new function called def record. Def record will consist of the self.density which help to examine the density, for each move a drunk takes, 1 will be added (+= 1) to the density. </p>

								<h3>Drunks plan</h3>
								<p> The drunk plan is a data file which consist of the map of the town. Futhermore, this data file will be pulled in the model using the import csv function. This will help to create the environment for the drunks and help to locate the houses and pubs. The data file contains a pub , houses (10, 250)

								<h3>Drunk Model </h3>
								<p>The drunk model is the main body of the program, this section will highlight each step to create program including creating the environment for the drunks, creating the variables, highlighting the pub points and house points. Futhermore, the drunk model will also highlight the density and save the density to text file. </p>
